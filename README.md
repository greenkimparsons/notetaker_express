# notetaker_using_express

# description
I started off with npm init -y then installing express. Then I started to code the routes as it was easier to reference from past materials. I had trouble with the paths as I did not know that I had to put the whole path.join(__dirname, ""). My tutor clarified that for me and with those fixes, it helped load the new Notes into an array and into the list and json file.
