# notetaker_using_express

# description
I started off with npm init -y then installing express. Then I started to code the routes as it was easier to reference from past materials. The Notes page's CSS wasn't working so had to add a line of code (line 14) on server.js file. I had trouble with the paths as I did not know that I had to put the whole path.join(__dirname, ""). My tutor clarified that for me and with those fixes, it helped load the new Notes into an array and into the list and json file. I attempted the delete requirement but the unique id was a bit difficult as I didn't know how to get the same ids and then to delete that object. Will continue to work on it!
